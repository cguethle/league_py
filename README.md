# league_py
Yet another wrapper around the LoL API.

No, really, there are a lot of them out there. The existance of my module is not a statement on how good or bad they are. I just play LoL some and thought this would be a fun side project. That said, this thing is nowhere near meant for general consumption. It is not complete in any way and your use of it is totally at risk.

That said, if you like it, clone it. :)  A bit of fair warning, as I work for a startup, this project is not my priority in any way. It was a bunch of play code that I thought people might find useful.

Cheers!
Chris
